# Training Improvements for Crop Insect Detection

## Problems Identified

Your model was stopping around epochs 20-23 due to several issues:

### 1. **No Proper Train/Validation Split**
- **Problem**: Using same data for training and validation (`val: images/train`)
- **Impact**: Model couldn't properly evaluate performance, leading to unreliable metrics
- **Solution**: Created proper 80/20 train/validation split (40 train, 10 validation images)

### 2. **Batch Size Too Large**
- **Problem**: Batch size of 16 was too large for only 50 images
- **Impact**: Poor gradient updates and unstable training
- **Solution**: Reduced to batch size 4-8 for better learning dynamics

### 3. **Aggressive Early Stopping**
- **Problem**: Patience of 20 epochs stopped training too early
- **Impact**: Model didn't have enough time to learn properly
- **Solution**: Increased patience to 50+ epochs or disabled early stopping

### 4. **Suboptimal Model Size**
- **Problem**: Using YOLOv8s (small) for a very small dataset
- **Impact**: Risk of overfitting with limited data
- **Solution**: Switched to YOLOv8n (nano) - better for small datasets

### 5. **Default Hyperparameters**
- **Problem**: Using default learning rates and optimization settings
- **Impact**: Not optimized for small dataset characteristics
- **Solution**: Tuned learning rate, optimizer, and augmentation settings

## Improvements Made

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`split_data.py`** - Splits dataset into proper train/validation sets
2. **`train_yolov8_improved.py`** - Optimized training script with 3 strategies
3. **`data.yaml`** - Updated to use proper validation path

### Key Optimizations:

#### **Strategy 1: Improved Training (Recommended)**
- YOLOv8n model (nano - less prone to overfitting)
- Batch size: 4
- Learning rate: 0.001 (lower)
- Patience: 50 epochs
- AdamW optimizer
- Moderate data augmentation
- Cosine learning rate scheduling

#### **Strategy 2: Nano Model Training**
- Even smaller image size (416px)
- Conservative augmentation
- Higher patience (100 epochs)
- Traditional SGD optimizer

#### **Strategy 3: No Early Stopping**
- Fixed 100 epochs to see full learning curve
- Helps understand model behavior
- Good for debugging training issues

### Data Augmentation Settings:
- **Rotation**: 5-15 degrees
- **Translation**: 5-10%
- **Scale**: 10-30%
- **HSV adjustments**: Moderate values
- **Horizontal flip**: 50% probability
- **Mosaic**: 30-70% (creates synthetic training examples)

## How to Use

1. **First, ensure proper data split:**
   ```bash
   python3 split_data.py
   ```

2. **Run improved training:**
   ```bash
   python3 train_yolov8_improved.py
   ```

3. **Choose strategy based on your needs:**
   - Option 1: General improvement (recommended)
   - Option 2: Fastest training (nano model)
   - Option 3: Full learning curve analysis

## Expected Results

With these improvements, you should see:
- ✅ More stable training curves
- ✅ Better validation metrics
- ✅ Training continuing beyond 20-30 epochs
- ✅ Gradual improvement in accuracy
- ✅ Less overfitting

## Tips for Small Datasets

1. **Collect more data** if possible (aim for 100+ images per class)
2. **Use data augmentation** to artificially increase dataset size
3. **Consider transfer learning** with pre-trained models
4. **Monitor both training and validation loss** to detect overfitting
5. **Be patient** - small datasets often need more epochs to converge

## Monitoring Training

Watch for these indicators:
- **Training loss** should decrease steadily
- **Validation loss** should decrease but may be more erratic
- **mAP50** (mean Average Precision) should gradually improve
- **Early stopping** should trigger only when validation metrics plateau

If training still stops early, try:
- Reducing learning rate further (0.0005)
- Increasing patience to 100+ epochs
- Adding more data augmentation
- Using smaller batch size (2-3)
